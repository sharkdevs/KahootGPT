# KahootGPT
Kahoot Browser extension that allows players to get answers quickly for Kahoot quizzes. The extension would use the GPT-3.5. This is Purely Hobby and going to be done with the help of ChatGPT
 

## Introduction 

  

Kahoot is a popular online learning platform that allows users to create and play interactive quizzes, games, and presentations. Kahoot can be used for various purposes, such as education, training, entertainment, and socializing. Kahoot games are hosted by a presenter who shares a game PIN with the participants, who join the game using their own devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or laptops) via a web browser or the Kahoot app. 

  

However, some users may find it challenging to answer the questions quickly and accurately, especially if they are unfamiliar with the topic or have limited time. This document proposes an idea for a browser extension that can help players to get answers quickly and easily. The extension will use the GPT-3.5 Turbo API, a powerful natural language processing (NLP) service that can generate high-quality text based on a given prompt or context. 

  

## Overview of the Extension 

  

The extension will be compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers, as these are the supported browsers for Kahoot platforms . The extension will work by detecting when a user is on a Kahoot game page (https://kahoot.it) and injecting a script that will access the game data and display an answer box below each question. The answer box will show the most likely answer for the question based on the GPT-3.5 Turbo API response. 

  

The extension will use the following workflow: 

  

1. The user installs the extension from the browser's web store and grants the necessary permissions. 

2. The user joins a Kahoot game using their browser and enters the game PIN. 

3. The extension detects that the user is on a Kahoot game page and injects a script that will access the game data. 

4. The script sends a request to the GPT-3.5 Turbo API with the question text and the four answer options as parameters. 

5. The GPT-3.5 Turbo API returns a response with the most likely answer for the question based on its internal model and knowledge base. 

6. The script displays an answer box below each question with the GPT-3.5 Turbo API response. 

7. The user can choose to click on the answer box to select the suggested answer or ignore it and select their own answer. 

  

## Benefits of the Extension 

  

The extension will provide several benefits for Kahoot players, such as: 

  

- Improving their chances of answering correctly and scoring higher in the game. 

- Saving time and effort by reducing the need to search for answers online or guess randomly. 

- Enhancing their learning experience by exposing them to new information and facts from the GPT-3.5 Turbo API response. 

- Having fun and enjoying the game more by using a smart and creative tool. 

  

## Challenges and Limitations of the Extension 

  

The extension will also face some challenges and limitations, such as: 

  

- Depending on the availability and reliability of the GPT-3.5 Turbo API service, which may have downtime or errors. 

- Requiring internet connection and sufficient bandwidth to send and receive requests to and from the GPT-3.5 Turbo API service. 

- Not guaranteeing 100% accuracy or validity of the GPT-3.5 Turbo API response, which may be influenced by bias, misinformation, or lack of context. 

- Potentially violating the terms of service or ethical standards of Kahoot or other parties involved in creating or hosting the games. 

- Being detected or blocked by Kahoot or other anti-cheating measures that may be implemented in the future. 

  

## Conclusion 

  

This document presented an idea for a browser extension that can help players to get answers quickly and easily for Kahoot games using the GPT-3.5 Turbo API service. The extension will have several benefits but also some challenges and limitations that need to be considered before developing and deploying it. The extension will aim to provide a fun and engaging way for users to enjoy Kahoot games while also learning new things from the GPT-3.5 Turbo API response.
